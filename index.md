## Hello!

I am currently a Senior Scientist at Applied Biomath. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral research associate with [Alan M. Jones](https://bio.unc.edu/faculty-profile/jones/) and [Timothy C. Elston](https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/directory/timothy-elston/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware under the advisement of [Abhyudai Singh](https://udel.edu/~absingh/) and received both Bachelors and Masters degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

My research integrates computational analyses with experimental data to answer fundamental questions in biology and medicine. Recent advancements in experimental techniques allow us to measure dynamics of various components of biological systems at subcellular, cellular, and population levels. These measurements show that biological systems are characteristically stochastic, nonlinear, and comprise multiple spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, understanding biological systems requires application of tools drawn from a range of computational disciplines. The iterative cycles of modeling, learning, and experimentation enable us to discover biological design principles, identify dysregulations that cause diseases, and suggest potential ways to manipulate the system for therapeutic purposes. Please see [my publications](/publications/) or [my Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2UQbyu4AAAAJ) to learn more about my research.
