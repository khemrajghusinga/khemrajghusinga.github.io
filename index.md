I am currently a postdoctoral research associate with [Alan M. Jones](https://bio.unc.edu/faculty-profile/jones/) and [Timothy C. Elston](https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/directory/timothy-elston/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am broadly interested in understanding biological systems using joint computational-experimental approaches.

Previously, I graduated with a PhD degree from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Delaware. I was advised by [Abhyudai Singh](https://udel.edu/~absingh/). Even before that, I obtained both Bachelors and Masters degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. I also had a stint in industry, working as a troubleshooting and commissioning engineer for turbogenerators and associated control systems with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited.

Thank you for visiting. If you would like to connect with me, please send me an email to: khem[at]email[dot]unc[dot]edu
