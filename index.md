## Hello!

I am currently a Senior Scientist at Applied Biomath, where I perform quantitative systems modeling and analysis for drug development.
Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware and received both Bachelors and Masters degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.





A long time ago, I graduated with both Bachelors and Masters degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. I also had a stint in industry, working as a troubleshooting and commissioning engineer for turbogenerators and associated control systems with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited.
