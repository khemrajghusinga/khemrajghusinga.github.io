## Hello!

I am currently a Senior Scientist at Applied Biomath, where I perform quantitative systems modeling and analysis for drug development.
Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral research associate with [Alan M. Jones](https://bio.unc.edu/faculty-profile/jones/) and [Timothy C. Elston](https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/directory/timothy-elston/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I obtained my PhD  in Electrical & Computer Engineering under the advisement of [Abhyudai Singh](https://udel.edu/~absingh/) at the University of Delaware. 

A long time ago, I was advised by . Even before that, I obtained both Bachelors and Masters degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. I also had a stint in industry, working as a troubleshooting and commissioning engineer for turbogenerators and associated control systems with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited.

Thank you for visiting. If you would like to connect with me, please send me an email to: khem[at]email[dot]unc[dot]edu
