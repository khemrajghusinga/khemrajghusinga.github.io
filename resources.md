### Color theory
---
Below are some websites/articles that give a brief overview of how color theory works, and how one can design graphs/figures to communicate the ideas better.

- Gabriela Plucinska's blog has a variety of resources on improving scientific communication, including suggestions on how to make better figures.
- Color Brewer provides color advice for cartography. Useful resource in picking color scheme for a figure.
- iWantHue can be used to pick color schemes.
- The Color Usage Research Lab at NASA has several useful resources, including the ColorTool.
- The Earth Observatory has a nice primer on  subtleties behind designing elegant figures.

### Miscellaneous
